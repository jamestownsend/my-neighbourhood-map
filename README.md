# Neighbourhood Map 
This is my final project for the Udacity Front End Web Development Nano Degree.

This app uses Google Maps API to generate the map environment and FourSquare API to pull location data.

By default the create-react-app includes a service worker to enable offline use.


## How to use

The user can scroll the map using the mouse and select the locations by clicking. Clicking a location will load an info window with the name and address.

The user can also use the filter search feature on the left menu. Clicking on links on the left-hand menu will also display an info window.


## How to open

   # You must have the following installed on your PC
      Node.js
      npm
      yarn
      Git

The project can be found on github
